Starter Special,"Balanced feed formula to take care of essential nutrients for the highest growth rate under varied stocking densities.
Use of high-quality feedstuffs from domestic and internationally reputed manufacturers with full traceability.
Effective utilization of marine proteins
Process technology ensures high digestibility, low microbial load, controlled.
Nutrient leaching for prolonged feed attractiveness and hence low FCR.
Highly water stable and fast sinking pellets for providing adequate palatability/nutrition during prolonged feeding hours.
Free from antibiotics, pesticides, pathogens, etc.
Provides immune enhancement / high pathogen challenge capability through highly stable vitamins, nucleotides and other micronutrients.
Well protected from oxidation and microbial attack Full traceability.
